# Hotel Management System

A comprehensive **C++** application developed to simplify the daily operations of a hotel. This system provides a digital solution for managing room availability, guest check-ins/check-outs, and automated billing through a menu-driven interface.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Room Booking & Allotment**: Easily check room availability and assign rooms to guests.
* **Guest Management**: Register guest details, including contact information and stay duration.
* **Search Functionality**: Quickly find guest records and room status using specific IDs or names.
* **Automated Billing**: Generates precise invoices based on room category and duration of stay.
* **Data Persistence**: Implements **File Handling** to store guest records in binary files, ensuring data is saved securely.
* **Record Modification**: Allows staff to update guest details or check out customers with automatic record updates.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project utilizes several core C++ concepts:
* **Classes & Objects**: To model rooms and guest profiles for clean, modular code.
* **File I/O (`fstream`)**: For reading and writing persistent records to `.dat` or `.txt` files.
* **Switch-Case Logic**: To create a seamless, user-friendly navigation menu.
* **Input Validation**: Ensures phone numbers and room IDs are entered in the correct format.
